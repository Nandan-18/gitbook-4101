# Peer Tutoring

## Signups

Peer tutoring is one of the most effective ways to solidify your understanding of computer science and programming. If you're struggling or falling behind, sign up for a peer tutor! There's no shame in asking for help when you need it.

You don't truly have something mastered until you can teach it. If you'd like to help others, you can sign up for that, too. We're always looking for talented peer tutors.
