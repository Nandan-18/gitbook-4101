# Problem Set 0

## **Summary**

We'll create our first IntelliJ project, initialize a Git repository, add and commit our project files, create a GitHub repository, and push our files to this remote repository.

## Requirements

1. Create a new IntelliJ project.
2. Create a Java class file called `HelloJava.java`.
3. Write a main method in HelloJava that prints `Hello, Java!` to the console.
4. Initialize a Git repository in the parent folder that contains `HelloJava.java`.
5. Add and commit your project files to version control.
6. Create a remote repository on GitHub called `pset-0`.
7. Push your project files to your remote repository.

## Deliverables

1. Submit your repository URL.

Your repository URL will look something like this: `github.com/your-username/your-repository`. If your username is `jdoe` and your repository \(as indicated in the requirements\) is called `pset-0`, then your URL will be `github.com/jdoe/pset-0`.

## Deadline

All submissions are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Sunday, September 13, 2020.
