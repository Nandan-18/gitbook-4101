# Problem Set 4

## **Summary**

Solve each exercise so that your output matches the expected output. Each exercise should be written in the `main` method of its own class. Follow a file naming convention of `ExericseX.java`, where `X` is 1 through 10, for each class file.

## Requirements

1. Create a new repository called `pset-4`.
2. Solve each of the 10 exercises \(to be self-contained in their own `.java` files\).
3. Add, commit, and push the corrected code to the `pset-4` repository.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write code that meets the stated requirements, and matches my output exactly. Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.

### Exercise 1

Prompt the user to enter a whole number of miles. Convert this distance into feet and inches.





## Deliverables

1. Submit your repository URL.

Your program output should match mine exactly for each of the 10 exercises above.

## Deadline

All submissions are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Sunday, September 27, 2020.
