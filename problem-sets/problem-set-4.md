# Problem Set 4

## **Summary**

Solve each exercise so that your output matches the expected output. Each exercise should be written in the `main` method of its own class. Follow a file naming convention of `ExerciseX.java`, where `X` is 1 through 10, for each class file.

## Requirements

1. Create a new repository called `pset-3`.
2. Solve each of the exercises, placing each solution in its own file.
3. Add, commit, and push your code to the `pset-3` repository.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write code that meets the stated requirements, and matches my output exactly. Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.

### Exercise 1

According the National Weather Service, wind chill is calculated by the following formula.

* `Side      :` 

Calculate and print the area and perimeter of the corresponding hexagon.

* Display exactly two decimal places.
* Format the area and perimeter with separating commas, as needed.
* The use of `if` statements, `switch` statements, ternary operators, and loops is prohibited.
