# Problem Set 4

## **Summary**

Solve each exercise so that your output matches the expected output. Each exercise should be written in the `main` method of its own class. Follow a file naming convention of `ExericseX.java`, where `X` is 1 through 10, for each class file.

## Requirements

1. Create a new repository called `pset-4`.
2. Solve each of the 10 exercises \(to be self-contained in their own `.java` files\).
3. Add, commit, and push the corrected code to the `pset-4` repository.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write code that meets the stated requirements, and matches my output exactly. Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.

### Exercise 1

Prompt the user to enter a whole number of miles. Convert this distance into feet and inches. You should always maximize the larger unit of distance first.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 2

Prompt the user to enter a whole number of inches. Convert this distance into a number of miles, feet, and remaining inches. You should always maximize the larger unit of distance first.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 3

Prompt the user to enter a whole number of kilometers. Convert this distance into meters and centimeters. You should always maximize the larger unit of distance first.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 4

Prompt the user to enter a whole number of centimeters. Convert this distance into a number of kilometers, meters, and remaining centimeters. You should always maximize the larger unit of distance first.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 5

Prompt the user to enter the diameter of a circle. Calculate the area and circumference.

IMG

* Always display exactly two decimal places \(rounding, if necessary\).
* Format the area and circumference with separating commas when applicable.
* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 6

Prompt the user for a length and a width. Calculate the area, perimeter, and diagonal of the corresponding rectangle.

IMG

* Always display exactly two decimal places \(rounding, if necessary\).
* Format the area, perimeter, and diagonal with separating commas when applicable.
* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 7

Prompt the user to enter a side length. Calculate the area and perimeter of the corresponding hexagon.

IMG

* Always display exactly two decimal places \(rounding, if necessary\).
* Format the area and perimeter with separating commas when applicable.
* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 8

Prompt the user to enter a sequence of text. Reverse the first and second halves of the `String`, making sure each letter is capitalized.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 9

Prompt the user to enter their first, middle, and last names. Print their initials in all capital letters.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

### Exercise 10

Prompt the user to enter their favorite city. Print the original `String`, its length, and the capital and lowercase equivalents of the `String`.

IMG

* The use of `if` statements, ternary operators, `switch` statements, and loops is prohibited.

## Deliverables

1. Submit your repository URL.

Your program output should match mine exactly for each of the 10 exercises above.

## Deadline

All submissions are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Sunday, September 27, 2020.
