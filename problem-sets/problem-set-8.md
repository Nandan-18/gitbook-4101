# Problem Set 8

## Summary

Last time, we used built-in methods of the String class. For this problem set, our focus will be on implementing our own classes and methods. I've provided a simple `ATM` class, which demonstrates how a user might perform simple online banking actions. Your job is to implement the missing classes and methods. You cannot change `ATM` class in any way.

## Requirements

1. Create a repository called `pset-8`.
2. Mark your repository as private, and add me as a collaborator \(`ryanjwilson`\).
3. Pull down [the skeleton repository](https://github.com/ucvts/pset-8-4101) containing starter code.
4. Implementing the missing classes and methods.
5. Add, commit, and push your code to your `pset-8` repository.

## Analyzing the Starter Code

The only starter code you're getting is the `ATM` class. It's designed to simulate someone using an ATM \(hopefully we've all got a rough understanding of how this works\).

If you read carefully, you'll come across references and methods that aren't defined in the ATM class. Even if you don't read carefully, they should be glaringly obvious because the code won't compile with all of these unknown references.

Your job job is the implement the missing classes and methods so that the ATM class compiles and runs as expected. You are writing your code to fit my specifications, which means you cannot modify the `ATM` class in any way whatsoever.

## Reading the Documentation

Anything you're unable to glean from analyzing the `ATM` class, you'll need to turn to the public documentation. These Javadocs should look familiar if you've ever poked around the Oracle documentation for built-in Java classes.

[Download this `.zip` folder](https://canvas.instructure.com/files/114106258/download?download_frd=1), extract it, and open up the HTML files using the browser of your choosing.

## Deliverables

1. Submit your repository URL.

Your program output should match mine exactly for each of the exercises above. 

## Deadline

All submissions are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Wednesday, November 4, 2020.
