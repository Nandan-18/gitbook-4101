# Problem Set 3

## **Summary**

Solve each exercise so that your output matches the expected output. Each exercise should be written in the `main` method of its own class. Follow a file naming convention of `ExericseX.java`, where `X` is 1 through 10, for each class file.

## Requirements

1. Clone the `java-skeleton-pset-3` repository.
2. Create a new repository called `pset-3`.
3. Solve each of the 10 exercises \(self-contained in their own `.java` files\).
4. Add, commit, and push the corrected code to the `pset-3` repository.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write code that meets the stated requirements, and matches my output exactly. Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.

### Exercise 1

Print a square of text to the console.



Use a single `println` statement, and do not use the string concatenation operator.

### Exercise 2
